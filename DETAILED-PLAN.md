Project aeroForge-G3: Autonomous Multimodal Synthesis for Generative Aerospace Engineering1. Executive SummaryThe convergence of large multimodal models (LMMs) and high-fidelity physical simulation represents the defining technological paradigm of 2026. While the first phase of generative AI disrupted digital content creation—text, images, and video—the subsequent phase, anchored by the release of Google’s Gemini 3 model family, addresses the synthesis of physical systems. This report proposes aeroForge-G3, a fundable, high-impact project for the Gemini 3 Hackathon (February 2026), designed to serve as an autonomous "Digital Chief Engineer" for the aerospace and drone manufacturing sectors.aeroForge-G3 leverages Gemini 3’s "Deep Think" capabilities and "System 2" reasoning to transform natural language requirements into manufacturing-ready Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models, validated through real-time physics simulations using the Genesis engine. Unlike preceding generative design tools that relied on surface-level mimicry, aeroForge-G3 grounds its outputs in the immutable laws of physics, utilizing an agentic swarm architecture to perform iterative structural optimization, aerodynamic analysis, and supply chain sourcing. This project directly addresses the "Computational Scientific Discovery" theme by automating the scientific method within the engineering design loop—hypothesizing geometries, testing them against physical constraints, and refining them based on empirical simulation data.The commercial viability of aeroForge-G3 is supported by the 2026 market landscape, where the global generative AI market is projected to exceed $55 billion, with the generative design sub-segment entering a period of hyper-growth driven by "reindustrialization" and "economic security" investment themes. By compressing the design-simulate-test cycle from months to minutes, aeroForge-G3 offers a verified return on investment (ROI) for defense contractors, logistics firms, and advanced manufacturing startups. The project aligns seamlessly with the investment theses of Gradient Ventures and the Google AI Futures Fund, offering a "0-to-1" vertical AI solution that transitions enterprise operations from automated to fully autonomous.2. The Era of Autonomous Engineering2.1 The Shift from Automation to AutonomyBy early 2026, the enterprise technology landscape has undergone a fundamental transition from simple automation to genuine autonomy. Traditional automation relies on predefined rules to execute repetitive tasks, a paradigm that served the "Industry 4.0" era well but proved brittle in the face of dynamic, unstructured challenges. The emerging "Autonomous Enterprise," however, is characterized by self-governing agents capable of reasoning, planning, and executing complex workflows with minimal human intervention.In the domain of engineering, this shift is particularly profound. The role of the engineer is evolving from a creator of geometry to a curator of constraints. The "Digital CIO" or "Digital Chief Engineer" does not merely assist humans; it takes ownership of the entire design lifecycle, identifying optimal trade-offs between conflicting variables such as weight, structural integrity, and manufacturing cost. aeroForge-G3 embodies this transition, functioning not as a tool but as an intelligent agentic colleague.2.2 The Bottleneck of Physical DesignDespite advances in digital tools, the physical design process in aerospace remains plagued by inefficiencies. The iterative cycle of designing a component in CAD, exporting it for Finite Element Analysis (FEA) or Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), waiting for solver convergence, and then manually revising the geometry is inherently slow and disjointed. This latency is exacerbated by a global shortage of niche expertise in advanced materials and aerodynamics.Furthermore, existing "Text-to-CAD" solutions have historically struggled with precision. Generative models trained solely on image data or unstructured text often produce "dumb" meshes—3D objects that look correct visually but lack the parametric definitions required for manufacturing. They are susceptible to "hallucinations" where physical properties are ignored; a drone chassis might be generated with disconnected struts or non-manifold geometry that renders it unprintable.2.3 The Computational Scientific Discovery OpportunityThe prompt for the Gemini 3 Hackathon specifically encourages concepts centered on "Computational Scientific Discovery." In the context of aeroForge-G3, this translates to the use of AI to accelerate the discovery of optimal physical forms. Just as AlphaFold revolutionized biology by predicting protein structures, aeroForge-G3 revolutionizes mechanical engineering by predicting optimal aerodynamic structures. It treats the design space as a high-dimensional scientific search problem, using Gemini 3’s reasoning capabilities to navigate the landscape of possible geometries and material compositions to find solutions that no human engineer would intuit.3. The Gemini 3 Technological SubstrateThe feasibility of aeroForge-G3 rests entirely on the specific architectural advancements introduced with Google’s Gemini 3 family. Previous models lacked the reasoning depth and context management required to handle the complexities of aerospace engineering.3.1 Model Architecture and Reasoning CapabilitiesGemini 3 introduces a tiered architecture comprising Gemini 3 Pro, Gemini 3 Flash, and the specialized Deep Think mode.3.1.1 Gemini 3 Pro and Deep ThinkGemini 3 Pro serves as the central intelligence of the aeroForge-G3 system. Its defining feature is the "Deep Think" capability, which utilizes "System 2" reasoning—a cognitive process analogous to slow, deliberate human thought. When engaged, the model pauses to generate a chain of thought, verifying logical steps and planning complex sequences before emitting a response.
For aerospace engineering, this is non-negotiable. A design agent cannot "guess" the stress distribution on a rotor arm; it must reason through the load path. The API allows developers to control the thinking_level, enabling aeroForge-G3 to toggle between fast heuristics for initial brainstorming and rigorous, computation-heavy reasoning for final validation.3.1.2 Gemini 3 Flash and Real-Time PerceptionGemini 3 Flash provides the speed required for real-time feedback loops. In the aeroForge-G3 architecture, Flash is utilized for visual quality assurance (QA) and rapid iteration. Its low latency allows it to monitor the visual output of physics simulations (rendered via the Genesis engine) and make sub-second adjustments to the design parameters if instability is detected.3.2 Multimodal Context and "Vibe Coding"The model’s 1 million+ token context window enables the ingestion of massive multimodal datasets. aeroForge-G3 can process entire repositories of technical documentation—such as FAA Part 107 regulations, material data sheets (MDS), and legacy CAD libraries—simultaneously.
Furthermore, Gemini 3’s "vibe coding" capability democratizes the creation of the engineering interface itself. A user can describe the desired analysis dashboard—"Show me a heatmap of aerodynamic drag overlaying the structural stress tensors"—and Gemini 3 generates the necessary frontend code (e.g., in Streamlit or React) on the fly, tailoring the user experience to the specific engineering task at hand.FeatureDescriptionApplication in aeroForge-G3Deep Think (System 2)Deliberate reasoning with pause-and-plan mechanics.Verifying physics compliance, energy conservation laws, and structural integrity calculations.Context Window1M+ tokens for massive data ingestion.Ingesting FAA regulations, material science databases, and entire project repositories for compliance checking.Native MultimodalitySeamless processing of text, code, images, and video.Interpreting 2D hand-sketches of drone concepts; analyzing video telemetry from simulations.Vibe CodingGenerating software interfaces from natural language.Creating dynamic, problem-specific simulation dashboards and visualization tools for the user.4. Market Landscape and Commercial Thesis (2026)The commercial environment in 2026 provides strong headwinds for "Deep Tech" and "Vertical AI" solutions. The generalist AI hype cycle has subsided, replaced by a focus on domain-specific agents that deliver tangible economic value.4.1 Market Sizing and Growth DynamicsThe global generative AI market is projected to reach $55.51 billion in 2026, driven by a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of over 30%. Within this, the "Generative Design" segment is entering a breakout phase. Valued at approximately $4.91 billion in 2026, this niche is expected to double by 2031, fueled by the manufacturing sector's demand for automation.The "Generative AI in Design" market specifically is expanding at a CAGR of 31.6%, with North America leading the adoption. This growth is not driven by hobbyists but by enterprise-grade adoption in automotive, aerospace, and defense industries, where the pressure to reduce "Time-to-Part" is intense.4.2 Investment Themes: Reindustrialization and Economic SecurityVenture capital investment theses in 2026 have pivoted toward "Economic Security" and "Reindustrialization". Geopolitical instability and supply chain fragility have forced Western economies to onshore critical manufacturing capabilities.Gradient Ventures (Google’s AI-focused fund) is actively investing in "Vertical AI"—systems trained on high-quality, domain-specific data that can automate complex professional workflows.Google AI Futures Fund targets "ambitious AI ideas" that leverage the latest DeepMind models to solve "0-to-1" problems.
aeroForge-G3 aligns perfectly with these themes. It serves as a force multiplier for reindustrialization, allowing a small team of engineers to produce output equivalent to a large defense prime contractor. It reduces reliance on offshore design firms and accelerates the development of sovereign hardware capabilities.4.3 The "Autonomous Enterprise" Maturity ModelThe market is moving up the "Autonomous Enterprise Maturity Model".Level 1 (Assisted): Human works, AI helps (e.g., Copilot).Level 2 (Automated): AI executes defined tasks (e.g., scripts).Level 3 (Autonomous): AI agents plan and execute workflows, human supervises.
aeroForge-G3 positions itself at Level 3. It does not just "help" design a drone; it receives a high-level intent ("Build a drone for XYZ mission") and autonomously orchestrates the design, simulation, and sourcing processes, only escalating to the human for final strategic approval.5. aeroForge-G3: Project Definition and User Persona5.1 The ConceptaeroForge-G3 is an end-to-end generative engineering platform that utilizes a multi-agent AI system to design, simulate, and procure aerospace components. It integrates:Generative CAD: Script-based parametric modeling (via build123d).Physics Simulation: Real-time fluid dynamics and rigid body physics (via Genesis).Supply Chain Intelligence: Automated component sourcing (via OpenBB and supplier APIs).5.2 Target User PersonaThe primary user persona is the "Hardware Founder" or the "Rapid Response Engineer" at a defense/logistics startup.Needs: Speed (days, not months), physical accuracy (cannot afford prototypes that crash), and supply chain visibility.Pain Points: Expensive CAD licenses (SolidWorks/Catia), steep learning curve for simulation software (Ansys), and fragmented supplier networks.Behavior: They are technical but resource-constrained. They need a tool that acts as a force multiplier, effectively giving them a "Digital Engineering Team" in a box.5.3 Value PropositionaeroForge-G3 offers a verified ROI by recovering "engineering productivity". Instead of spending weeks iterating on wing profiles, the engineer delegates this to the Gemini 3 agents. The platform enables "Vibe Engineering"—the ability to iterate on physical designs at the speed of thought/conversation, grounded in the rigorous math of physics engines.6. Technical Architecture: The Combative Multi-Agent SwarmTo achieve "PhD-level" engineering output, aeroForge-G3 utilizes a "Combative Multi-Agent Architecture". A single LLM prompt is often insufficient for complex engineering due to the risk of "yes-man" behavior (hallucination). Instead, distinct agents with opposing goals debate the design to ensure robustness.6.1 Agent Roles and ResponsibilitiesAgent NameModelFunctionTool AccessArchitect (The Visionary)Gemini 3 ProDecomposes user prompt into engineering requirements.

Instead, it relies on Code-Defined Geometry. The Constructor agent writes Python code using the build123d library.Why Code? Code is precise, version-controllable, and parametric. An LLM can easily reason that thickness = 5mm should be changed to thickness = 7mm in a script. Editing a raw STL mesh to be 2mm thicker is mathematically complex and error-prone.Library Choice: build123d is chosen over OpenSCAD because it is Python-native, allowing seamless integration with scientific libraries (NumPy, SciPy) and providing a more modern, fluent API that is easier for LLMs to learn and utilize.7. Scientific Grounding: Physics Simulation IntegrationThe "Computational Scientific Discovery" aspect of the project is anchored in its simulation capabilities. aeroForge-G3 does not just guess that a drone will fly; it mathematically proves it.7.1 The Genesis Physics EngineFor the hackathon, aeroForge-G3 integrates the Genesis physics platform. Genesis is a breakthrough "universal physics engine" developed for general-purpose robotics and embodied AI.Performance: It is highly optimized, capable of simulating over 43 million frames per second (FPS) for robotic agents, which is vastly faster than real-time. This speed allows the Physicist agent to run thousands of design permutations in seconds (Monte Carlo simulations) to find the global optimum.Multiphysics: Genesis supports rigid bodies, soft bodies, and fluids. This is critical for drones, as it allows for the simulation of both the rigid frame dynamics and the aerodynamic fluid interactions (air resistance, turbulence).7.2 Alternative Simulation PathwaysWhile Genesis is the primary engine, the architecture supports specialized solvers for specific tasks:JaxCFD: For detailed aerodynamic analysis, the system can offload tasks to JaxCFD, a fully differentiable Computational Fluid Dynamics solver written in JAX. This allows for "end-to-end optimization," where the gradients of the drag coefficient can be backpropagated directly to the CAD parameters, allowing the AI to "learn" the optimal shape via gradient descent.Simulation Export: The system uses mjcf_urdf_simple_converter and custom scripts to export the generated CAD models into URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) or MJCF (MuJoCo XML) formats. This ensures interoperability with industry-standard simulators like NVIDIA Isaac Sim and MuJoCo.7.3 Mathematical ValidationThe Physicist agent is prompted to explicitly verify mathematical laws during the Deep Think phase. For a drone hovering, it verifies:$$T_{total} \geq m \cdot g \cdot S_f$$Where $T_{total}$ is total thrust, $m$ is mass, $g$ is gravity, and $S_f$ is the safety factor.For structural beams (drone arms), it calculates deflection $\delta$:$$\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}$$Where $F$ is load, $L$ is length, $E$ is elastic modulus (material property sourced by Agent D), and $I$ is the moment of inertia (derived from the Agent C's CAD geometry).By exposing these "Chain of Thought" calculations to the user, aeroForge-G3 builds trust—a critical factor for "white-box" AI engineering.8. Broader Implications for Computational Scientific DiscoveryWhile aeroForge-G3 focuses on aerospace, its architecture is a blueprint for a broader class of "Generative Scientific Discovery" tools. The pattern of Design (Agent) $\rightarrow$ Simulate (Physics Engine) $\rightarrow$ Analyze (Reasoning Model) is universally applicable.8.1 Material Science and DiscoveryThe architecture can be adapted to discover new materials. By swapping build123d for a molecular design tool and Genesis for a molecular dynamics engine (like LAMMPS or MatterSim), the system could autonomously explore the space of inorganic crystals or polymers. The "Deep Think" mode would reason about crystal lattice stability and bandgaps, while the sourcing agent would check for the availability of precursor chemicals.8.2 Biotechnology and Protein EngineeringIn biotech, the system could integrate with tools like Foldy or AlphaFold. The generative agent would propose amino acid sequences, the simulation agent would predict folding structures and docking affinities, and the "Physicist" (now "Biologist") agent would evaluate efficacy against a target pathogen. This creates a "Self-Driving Lab" for drug discovery, a concept heavily supported by current academic research.8.3 Optical Computing and MetamaterialsRecent research from Stanford demonstrates using agentic AI for the design of optical metasurfaces. aeroForge-G3 could extend to this domain, designing nanoscale structures to manipulate light. The "Constructor" agent would generate lithography masks, while the simulation engine would solve Maxwell’s equations to verify optical performance.9. Implementation Roadmap: The Hackathon StrategyTo win the Gemini 3 Hackathon, the team must demonstrate a functioning loop, not just a concept.9.1 Tech Stack SelectionComponentTechnologyRationaleCore IntelligenceGemini 3 Pro & FlashState-of-the-art reasoning and speed.OrchestrationLangGraph (Python)robust state management for multi-agent loops.CAD Kernelbuild123d (Python)Code-native, parametric, AI-friendly.Physics EngineGenesis (Python)Fast, differentiable, multimodal simulation.FrontendStreamlit + stpyvistaRapid UI development, 3D visualization support.Data SourceOpenBB / SerperReal-time market/supply chain data.9.2 Development Phases (Pre-Hackathon & Weekend)Phase 1: The Core (Pre-Hackathon Prep)Goal: Establish the CAD-to-Simulation pipeline.Task: Write a Python script that takes a build123d object, exports it to URDF, and loads it into a Genesis scene. This "plumbing" is the hardest part and must be robust before the event.Phase 2: The Brain (Hackathon Day 1)Goal: Implement the Multi-Agent System.Task: Connect Gemini 3 API. Prompt engineer the "Physicist" and "Constructor" personas. Implement the "Deep Think" validation logic. Use the thinking_level parameter to optimize latency.Phase 3: The Interface (Hackathon Day 2)Goal: "Vibe Coding" the UI.Task: Use Gemini 3 to write the Streamlit frontend. Implement the 3D viewer using stpyvista to allow judges to interact with the generated drones. Integrate the OpenBB API to show "Live Cost Estimation" tickers, adding commercial realism.9.3 Demo NarrativeThe demo will feature a live "design sprint":Prompt: "We need a drone to deliver medical supplies to a mountain village. High winds, 2kg payload."Action: The agents start debating. The Architect suggests a hexacopter for stability. The Physicist runs a wind tunnel sim in Genesis. The Sourcing agent flags that the suggested motors are backordered and proposes an alternative.Result: A fully rendered, physics-validated drone model appears on screen, spinning in 3D, with a "Buy Now" button linked to a generated BOM.10. Risks and Mitigation10.1 Hallucination in Physical ReasoningRisk: Large Language Models can hallucinate plausible-sounding but physically impossible designs (e.g., overlapping geometries, impossible centers of mass).
Mitigation: The "Deep Think" mode acts as a logical filter. Furthermore, the system uses Code Execution as the source of truth. The AI does not generate the geometry directly (as pixels/voxels); it generates code. If the code fails to compile or the physics engine detects a collision, the system catches the error deterministically and forces a retry.10.2 Computational CostRisk: Running extensive physics simulations and "Deep Think" inference is expensive.
Mitigation: The architecture uses a tiered approach. Gemini 3 Flash (low cost) handles the initial brainstorming and sourcing. "Deep Think" (high cost) is reserved for the final validation step. Genesis is optimized for GPU acceleration, minimizing simulation costs compared to traditional CPU-based solvers.10.3 Regulatory ComplianceRisk: Generating aerospace designs that violate FAA/EASA regulations.
Mitigation: The Architect agent uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to access a vector database of current regulations (FAA Part 107). It treats these regulations as hard constraints in the prompt instructions.11. Conclusion: The "iPhone Moment" for EngineeringProject aeroForge-G3 represents more than just a hackathon entry; it is a prototype for the future of industrial creation. By fusing the reasoning power of Gemini 3 with the rigor of the Genesis physics engine, it bridges the chasm between the digital imagination and the physical world.This project is "brilliant" because it targets the hardest problem in AI—grounding intelligence in physical reality. It is "fundable" because it addresses a multi-billion dollar market need for autonomous engineering and reindustrialization capability. It is "high-impact" because it democratizes access to aerospace engineering, allowing a single innovator to rival the capabilities of a major defense contractor.In the trajectory of the 2026 AI landscape, aeroForge-G3 stands as a flagship example of "Computational Scientific Discovery," transforming the static "Computer-Aided Design" of the past into the dynamic "Computer-Augmented Invention" of the future. It is the realization of the Autonomous Enterprise, delivering on the promise that AI will not just talk about the world, but help us build it.
